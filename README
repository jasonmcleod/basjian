Basjian is a multiplayer game written in node.js. The client is... you guessed it, all javascript.

I wrote Basjian because all the retro RPG's I've played over the years have either gone away or
just turned into something other than they used to be.

I did a 3 month sprint when I wrote Basjian.. trouble is, that's also when I learned node.js, so
the code is a little unmanageable.  I also let the excitement get the best of me so several pieces
of the client are a little rushed.  On top of that, I got busy and put the project away for a while.

So now, I'm rewriting Basjian, and making it open source.  Maybe I'll find another developer who
is looking for a retro RPG to feed their nostalgic craving. But if not, I still enjoy playing what
Basjian is so far.  You can get a taste of whats to come right now at http://basjian.com.

Once the code here catches up to what's live now, I'll move it into production and hopefully keep
on truckin!
